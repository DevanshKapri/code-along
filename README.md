# code-along

Repository for Coding Practice of IEEE Members.

## Pre-requisites:

- Introduction to Git/Github:
  - [FreeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk), or [CS50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcoBAfJ6l2Q), or any other complete Git/GitHub tutorial on Youtube.
  - [Git Guide by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
  - Markdown Language - [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code)

## How to get started with CP/DSA?

1.  Clone this repository using this command -
    `git clone https://github.com/DevanshKapri/code-along.git`

2.  Create a branch with your name and cpp. (e.g. devansh-cpp)
    `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>`

3.  Update the readme with problems that you've completed using the following template. Add new table for ever Problem Set and replace X with the Set No.

    ```
    #### Name - <your-name>
    #### Branch - <your-branch>
    #### Pset X -
    | Problem Link | Status | Submission Link |
    | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    | Link 1 | Done | Sub-Link 1 |
    | Link 2 | Done | Sub-Link 2 |
    | Link 3 | Not Done |  |
    ```

    It'll look something like this -

    #### Name - Ayush Verma

    #### Branch - Ayush-cpp

    #### Pset X - 1

    | Problem Link |  Status  | Submission Link |
    | ------------ | :------: | --------------: |
    | [Link 1](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/231/A)     |   Done   |      [Sub-Link 1](https://codeforces.com/problemset/submission/231/176646799) |
    | [Link 2](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A)       |   Done   |      [Sub-Link 2](https://codeforces.com/problemset/submission/4/176648019)   |
    | [Link 3](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1/A)       |   Done   |      [Sub-Link 3](https://codeforces.com/problemset/submission/1/176649384)   |
    | [Link 4](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/69/A)      |   Done   |      [Sub-Link 4](https://codeforces.com/problemset/submission/69/176651460)  |
    | [Link 5](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)              |   Done   |      [Sub-Link 5](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/submissions/)         |

4.  Commit and push the code to your branch after these steps.

    ```
    git commit -am "day 1 update"
    git push origin <your-branch-name>
    ```

5.  You can find problem sets updated regularly on the cpp branch. `git checkout <branch-name>` can be used to switch between branched.
